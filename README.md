# node-git
An alpine based node image with git preinstalled to support installing from git repositories

# problem solved
The default node alpine docker images do not contain git binaries. This breaks git based support.

# package.json and git?
Yes! You can host your own node modules using a public git repo instead of npmjs.org. This can help simplify your CI/CD workflow.
# Installing the npm packages from git

* Navigate to the npm package GitHub repository.
* Copy the https URL available on the browser tab and run the npm install command like this.
* npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios
This installs the forked axios package from the GitHub repository and it adds the following dependency to your package.json file.

```
"axios": "git+https://github.com/rightisleft/axios",
```

You can set the version of an npm package from the GitHub repository from git tag or commit hash

### Git Tag
```
npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios#v0.15.1
```

 ### Git Hash
```
npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios#3f8b128
```
