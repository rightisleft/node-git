# node-git
A `node:16-alpine:latest` image with git preinstalled to support installing from git repositories

## On Docker Hub
[https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rightisleft/node-git](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rightisleft/node-git)

## Problem Solved
The default node alpine docker images do not contain git binaries. This breaks git based support.

```

```
## package.json and git?

Yes! You can host your own node modules using a public git repo instead of npmjs.org. This can help simplify your CI/CD workflow.
## Installing the npm packages from git

* Navigate to the npm package GitHub repository.

* Copy the https URL available on the browser tab and run the npm install command like this.

* npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios
This installs the forked axios package from the GitHub repository and it adds the following dependency to your package.json file.

```
"axios": "git+https://github.com/rightisleft/axios",
```

You can set the version of an npm package from the GitHub repository from git tag or commit hash

*Git Tag*
```
npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios#v0.15.1
```

 *Git Hash*
```
npm install https://github.com/rightisleft/axios#3f8b128
```

## NPM Prepare: Avoid Complicated Build Systems

For projects like typescript, you can use the `prepare` script to execute a build stop. This will be run AFTER npm downloads your rep enabling you to compile libraries on your local machine. This is great for development, i would not recomend this for production.

```
  "scripts": {
    "dist": "tsc",
    "test": "mocha -r ts-node/register ./test/**/*",
    "prepack": "tsc",
  }
```

### Warning

It looks like there was an error with how older versions npm handled 'devDependencies' and git repos. If your 'typescript' library was declared there it would not get installed a 'prepack' would fail. I suggest using npm 7.18.1 or newer.
